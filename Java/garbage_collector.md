What is Garbage Collection in Java?

Garbage Collection (GC) is Java’s automatic memory management process.

👉 Its job is to:

Find objects in heap memory that are no longer used

Free that memory automatically

So you don’t manually free memory like in C/C++. JVM handles it for you.

Simple example
Person p = new Person();  // object created
p = null;                 // object eligible for GC


Once there are no references to the object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

⚠️ Important:
GC decides when to run — you can’t force it.

How does Garbage Collector decide?

GC checks reachability:

If an object is reachable from GC Roots, it stays

Otherwise, it’s garbage

GC Roots include:

Local variables (method stack)

Static variables

Active threads

JNI references

Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

Different GC algorithms exist for different use cases (low latency, high throughput, etc.).

1. Serial Garbage Collector

Best for: Small applications, single CPU

Uses single thread

Stops the world during GC

Simple and low overhead

📌 Enable:

-XX:+UseSerialGC

2. Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput GC)

Best for: High-throughput apps

Uses multiple threads

Faster GC than Serial

Still stop-the-world

📌 Default GC in Java 8

-XX:+UseParallelGC

3. CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) – ⚠ Deprecated

Best for: Low-latency apps (older JVMs)

Runs GC concurrently with application

Reduces pause times

Causes fragmentation

📌 Deprecated since Java 9

4. G1 Garbage Collector (Most Popular Now)

Best for: Large heap, low latency + good throughput

Heap divided into regions

Collects garbage incrementally

Predictable pause times

📌 Default GC from Java 9+

-XX:+UseG1GC

5. ZGC (Ultra-Low Latency)

Best for: Huge heaps, real-time systems

Pause times in milliseconds

Almost fully concurrent

Very scalable

📌 Java 11+

-XX:+UseZGC

6. Shenandoah GC

Best for: Low pause time, Red Hat JVMs

Concurrent compaction

Very low latency

📌

-XX:+UseShenandoahGC

Generational Garbage Collection

Most collectors use Generational GC based on this idea:

Most objects die young

Heap Structure
Generation	Purpose
Young Gen	New objects
Old Gen	Long-lived objects
Metaspace	Class metadata
Young Generation spaces:

Eden

Survivor S0 / S1

Types of GC Events
GC Type	Description
Minor GC	Cleans Young Gen
Major GC	Cleans Old Gen
Full GC	Cleans entire heap (slow!)
Can we request GC manually?

Yes, but JVM may ignore it:

System.gc();


Use only for testing, never in production.

Real-World Tip (Very Important)

In production:

Prefer G1GC (default)

Monitor with:

GC logs

JConsole / VisualVM

Avoid:

Creating too many short-lived objects

Memory leaks via static references
